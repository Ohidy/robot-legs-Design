# robot-legs-Design
robot legs design using shaper 3D 
I wanted to use Cinema 4D but it was hard to use and I wanted to use TinkerCard but I already used it to design a robot arm so I wanted to try something new on the iPad I made this design using my imagination as an artist who loves to draw my design may lack some stuff but in my head I wanted to fix it by adding holes and space for the servo and fixing some things if I could print it in real life
but over all thats how i wanted it to be as a final product it looks like a lego legs
